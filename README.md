This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This frontend application will require backend to be fully functional. The backend that I am referring to is [Email Notification Service](https://github.com/calvadoz/email-notification-service).

Also, not to forget, this is a real time application that makes use of [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) to keep track status and receive any email sent through the backend endpoint.

Therefore, please head over to the backend repository to get more insights and explanation of the entire application.
